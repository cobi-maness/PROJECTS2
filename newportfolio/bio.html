    My name is Cobi Scott Maness better known as Cobi Scott Maness. I like stuff like music (preferably Kanye), life (preferably dead), and making stuff (preferably stuff that I like). I wanna be sort of a jack of all trades type. I wanna be expireinced in everything related to what I really wanna do (direct movies). So that means web design, photpgraphy, writing, directing, marketing, graphic design, music, songwriting, advertising, design, acting etc. I'm also surprisingly good at basketball if thats relevent
