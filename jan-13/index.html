        <h1>Snowflame</h1>
        <p>
          Snow Flame's first and only appearance was against the New Guardians when they attempted to stop his drug cartel. Snow Flame easily bested the team in their first battle against him after he ordered his men to simply shoot the heroes. The heroes survived and faced off against Snow Flame once more. This time they did much better and after a chaotic battle Snow Flame was tossed into a shed, by his followers, which promptly exploded. He was assumed dead and has never been seen again.
